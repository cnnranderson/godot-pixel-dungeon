# Godot Game Project Template
### --UNDER CONSTRUCTION--

Simple skeleton project for starting Godot games. This template was inspired by the
scene transition structures found in the "Sealed Bite" project (found [here](https://github.com/securas/SealedBite)).


## Notes

There are a few things that may need to be setup or understood in order to fully take
advantage of this template project.

- Screen "Transition" effects are not fully provided (I am working on a sample branch to demonstrate this)
- The default pause mode of the MainScene/$Scene node is set to STOP. If you want it to be INHERIT so subnodes
of scenes being loaded can choose whether or not they become paused when the scene transitions, that's where you
can change it.
- Further notes are *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*
